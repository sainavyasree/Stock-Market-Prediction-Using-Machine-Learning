# Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning

As the name suggests, this project will use different Machine Learning algorithms to predict the stocks on a given stocks dataset. The purpose of this project is to compare different algorithms on the prediction of stocks and evaluate models by comparing prediction accuracy. The accuracy is calculated using RMSE of all the models.  We examined a few models including Linear regression, KNN,  LSTM. For forecasting, we used historical data of NSE stock market of ‘Tata Global Beverages’.

## Dataset

We’ll be using a dataset from Quandl. The 'NSE-TATAGLOBALBVG.csv' is the dataset which is already included with the repository.
